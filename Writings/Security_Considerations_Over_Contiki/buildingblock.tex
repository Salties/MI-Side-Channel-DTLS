\chapter{Building Blocks of WSN} \label{Chp: Building Blocks}

In this chapter, we introduce the building blocks of a WSN using OSI model\cite{OSI}.

The data channel in OSI model is descried as a set of protocols stacked layer by layer from the Physical Layer at the bottom to the Application Layer at the top (\Cref{fig: OSI model}). Ideally, lower layer protocols provide an universal  interface to upper layer protocols; thus providing flexibility to protocol choice in different scenarios as well as interoperability between nodes with different lower level structures.

	\caption{OSI model} \label{fig: OSI model}
\end{figure*}

\Cref{fig: OSI channel} demonstrates a typical data transmission in OSI modelled network. The application data is encapsulated by the sender from top to the bottom, with each encapsulation adds additional metadata, namely protocol headers, to the data. The receiver unwinds the process and reads out the data.

	\caption{Data Transfer in OSI model} \label{fig: OSI channel}
\end{figure*}

However, in real world scenarios the boundaries between the top three layers are usually ambiguous; many context, including this report, simply refers them all together as Application Layer. In most scenarios the application only needs the Transport Layer interfaces and anything beneath is transparent.

A selection of protocols at each layer is called a protocol suite, or a protocol stack. 8 bits is called an OCTET in network terminology but for readability in general computer science we use BYTE to represent the unit of 8 bits.

Protocols from Physical Layer to Transport Layer are implemented by hardware or kernel. Since most IoT devices are extremely resource constrained; thus it is hard to directly transplant the widely used TCP/IP protocol suite to WSNs. Instead, different protocols and operating systems are specifically designed for WSN applications. Contiki\cite{Contiki} is a highly customisable IoT system with 6LoWPAN\cite{rfc4919} support and can run on many recent IoT hardware, OpenWSN\cite{OpenWSN} is also a popular IoT system that has well integrated 6LoWPAN with CoAP\cite{rfc7252} and FreeRTOS\cite{FreeRTOS} is optimised for real time applications, etc. There are many other IoT systems and protocols that we do not list here. In this research, we build our experimental WSN over Contiki with 6LoWPAN due to their popularity in academic and industry.

Following in \Cref{Chp: Building Blocks} we introduce the building blocks of our experimental WSN from the bottom to the top in OSI model.

\section{Physical Layer}
Physical Layer protocols (or standards) specify the hardware requirements. They basically defines how a bit is transmitted over a physical medium.

WSN features, as can be seen by its name, wireless connectivity. 802.15.4\cite{802154} standard is supported in many recent WSN devices. The  802.15.4 Physical Layer specification, 802.15.4 PHY, is crafted to be suitable for embedded wireless devices emphasising low energy, low cost and low speed. Bluetooth Low Energy\cite{BLE}, BLE, is another candidate for WSN with similar features. \cite{802154BLE} provides a performance analysis of 802.15.4 and BLE.

\Cref{Fig: 802.15.4 PHY Frame} shows the constitution of a Physical Layer frame. A frame is a bit string transmitted sequentially from the left in the figure to the right. We use the same representations for the rest in \Cref{Chp: Building Blocks}.

\begin{table}[h!]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
		\hline
		Preamble & SFD & MAC Frame Length & Reserved & MAC Frame\\ \hline
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{802.15.4 PHY Frame}
	\label{Fig: 802.15.4 PHY Frame}
\end{table}

We omit the further details of 802.15.4 PHY standard as they strongly relate to hardware details which is beyond the scope of this report. We give only a brief explanation of the contents in the frame.

\textbf{Preamble} is a flag used for hardware synchronisation. \textbf{Start Frame Delimiter}, SFD, is a constantly 0xE5 for 802.15.4 frames which marks the begin of data in this frame. \textbf{MAC Frame Length} is a value of 0 to 127 indicating the number of bytes in the following \textbf{MAC Frame}, which we explain in \Cref{Sec: Data Link Layer}.

\section{Data Link Layer} \label{Sec: Data Link Layer}
Data Link Layer protocols manages the Physical Layer channel. In case of WSN, this is effectively Radio Frequency, RF. Data Link protocols are strongly related to physical features of underlining devices. 

Data Link Layer is  also referred as Media Access Control, MAC, Layer for convenience. A MAC Frame is the atomic data transferring unit in this layer. MAC Layer protocols define data transmission between physically connected devices, i.e. single hop communication. Packet forward is defined in upper layer protocols.

In case of WSN, a MAC Frame is always broadcasted to the sender’s neighbour due to the physical nature of RF. To avoid interference, MAC protocols adopts  techniques such as CSMA/CA \cite{802154} or TSCH\cite{TSCH} to solve the problem of how MAC Frames should be sent. Further more, other techniques like ContikiMAC\cite{ContikiMAC} proposes a sub Radio Duty Cycle, RDC, Layer protocol that aims to improve the energy efficiency of RF.

As of this research, we are more focused on the contents in a MAC Frame defined by 802.15.4 MAC Layer specification\cite{802154}, 802.15.4 MAC.

\subsection{802.15.4 MAC} \label{Subsec: 802.15.4 MAC}
802.15.4 MAC defined four types of MAC Frames.
\begin{description}[style=nextline]
	\item[\textbf{Beacon}] 
	Beacon frame is broadcasted to physically organise the network.
	\item[\textbf{Command}] 
	Command frame is used for data channel maintenance.
	\item[\textbf{Data}] 
	Data frame carries data from upper layer protocols.
	\item[\textbf{ACK}] 
	ACK frame only optionally sent in response when requested by other frames to notify the sender that the frame is received. Some protocols use ACK frames, e.g. ContikiMAC uses it to inform the sender that the frame is received and hence terminates the resending process of sender.
\end{description}

We are particularly interested in Data frames as they are most relevant to application data. \Cref{Fig: 802154 Data Frame} describes its format.

\begin{figure*}[h!]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
		\multicolumn{3}{c}{\textit{MAC Header}}                           & \multicolumn{1}{c}{\textit{MAC Payload}} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{\textit{MAC Footer}}     \\ \hline
		2 (bytes)     & 1                    & 4 to 20              & *           & 2              \\ \hline
		Frame Control & Sequence Number & Address Information & Data        & Frame Checksum \\ \hline
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{802.15.4 Data Frame}
	\label{Fig: 802154 Data Frame}
\end{figure*}

\begin{description}[style=nextline]
	\item[\textbf{Frame Control}]
	This field contains the bit flags instructing how the receiver should interpret this frame, such as the type of frame, with ACK and security options on or not, and format of addresses, etc. When the security option is enabled, additional field will be added to the frame. We explain the security enabled frame later in \Cref{Subsec: 802154 Sec}. The full details of flags is defined by \cite{802154}.
	
	\item[\textbf{Sequence Number}]
	The sequence number is increased by one for each MAC Frame sent and wraps to 0 when reached maximum. The sequence number is mostly used to match ACKs when requested.
	
	\item[\textbf{Address Information}]
	This field contains source and destination MAC address of this frame. Their length are variable and is specified in Frame Control. Simply speaking, longer addresses are for larger networks and shorter for smaller ones. MAC address is derived from hardware and should be unique but configurable during runtime. As stated earlier, a MAC Frame is always received by all neighbours of the sender; therefore the receiver who does not match the destination will immediately drop the frame without processing it to upper layer.
	
	\item[\textbf{Data}]
	This is the MAC Layer data containing upper layer protocol headers and application data.
	
	\item[\textbf{Frame Checksum}]
	The checksum is used to check and correct the error induced by physical channel.
\end{description}

Frame Control, Sequence Number and Address Information together are called MAC Header. Data is therefore called MAC Payload respectively. 

As specified in 802.15.4 PHY, Maximum Transmission Unit, MTU, required by 802.15.4 MAC Frame is 127 bytes including the MAC header and footer. In other words, 802.15.4 compatible hardware are guaranteed to send frames up to 127 bytes but frames exceeding this value might be silently discarded. Since MAC Header and Footer consumes 25 bytes in a Data frame, there is actually 102 bytes left for MAC Payload.

Setting the security flag in Frame Control enables 802.15.4 Security and adds additional fields into the MAC header, which we describe in \Cref{Subsec: 802154 Sec}.

\subsection{802.15.4 Security} \label{Subsec: 802154 Sec}
802.15.4 Security is based on Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data, AEAD, with AES-128 being the underlining block cipher. Specifically, it provides encryption for MAC Payload and authenticity for the whole MAC Frame.

The format of a 802.15.4 Data frame with security option set is described in \Cref{Fig: 802154 sec frame}.

\begin{figure*}[h!]

	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
		\multicolumn{4}{c}{\textit{MAC Header}}                                                             & \multicolumn{2}{c}{\textit{MAC Payload}} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{\textit{MAC Footer}}     \\ \hline
		\multicolumn{3}{|c|}{\multirow{2}{*}{As MAC Header in \Cref{Fig: 802154 Data Frame}}} & 0 to 14 (bytes)                    & *             & 0/4/8/16         & 2              \\ \cline{4-7}

	\end{tabular}
	\caption{802.15.4 Frame with security option enabled} \label{Fig: 802154 sec frame}
\end{figure*}

The Auxiliary Security Header controls the security primitive and materials in 802.15.4 Security as shown in \Cref{Fig: Auxiliary Security Header of 802.15.4 Security}.

\begin{figure*}[h!]
	\center
	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
	\hline
	\multicolumn{3}{|c|}{Auxililary Security Header} \\ \hline
	3 bits          & 4 byte         & *             \\ \hline

	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Auxiliary Security Header of 802.15.4 Security}
	\label{Fig: Auxiliary Security Header of 802.15.4 Security}
\end{figure*}

\begin{description}[style=nextline]
	\item[\textbf{Security Level}]
	Security Level is represented by the first 3 bits in Auxiliary Security Header. The highest bit enables encryption and lower two bits controls the length of Message Integrity Code, MIC, which is equivalent to Message Authenticate Code in cryptographic terms.  MIC of $0$ length indicates no authentication. Particularly, the security level can be configured to be:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Encryption only. Only MAC Payload is encrypted in CTR mode.
		\item Authentication only. A CBC-MIC\footnote{Equivalent to CBC-MAC in cryptographic term.} computed on the whole frame is attached to the end of Data. Data is transmitted in plaintext. Length of the MIC can be either 32, 64 or 128 bits based on the lower two bits of Security Level.
		\item Encryption and authentication. The whole frame is processed in CCM*\cite{802154} mode. MAC Header is the associated data and MAC Payload the plaintext. The asterisk symbol requires that the nonce, or IV, must can be decoded to uniquely determine the exact format of output ciphertext. Length of the MIC can be either 32, 64 or 128 bits based on the lower two bits of Security Level.
	\end{itemize}
	\item[\textbf{Frame Counter}]
	4 bytes of Auxiliary Security Header is occupied by Frame Counter which increases by one for each frame sent. It constitutes part of the nonce in CCM* mode and is also used for replay detection.
	\item[\textbf{Key Strategy}]
	Key Strategy instructs which key to be used for this frame. The keys are presumed to be pre-shared in PAN\footnote{Personal Area Network} Information Base, PIB, which is a database containing information that is shared among the network. Keys are managed by groups and indexes within a group. The definition of groups depends on upper layer applications. The length of Key Strategy is variable.
\end{description}

More details of Auxiliary Security Header is defined by \cite{802154}.

Access Control List, ACL, is a data structure used to manage the keys during runtime. Each entry of ACL is paired with another node.  An ACL entry contains the following elements:
\begin{description}[style=nextline]
	\item[\textbf{Address}]
	The remote address, used as an identifier of ACL entry.
	\item[\textbf{Security Suite}]
	Effectively the Security Level associated to the remote address.
	\item[\textbf{Key}]
	The paired cryptographic key associated to the remote address.
	\item[\textbf{Last Initial Vector}]
	Nonce used for the last outgoing frame. Used to deduce next nonce to use.
	\item[\textbf{Replay Counter}]
	Nonce received for the last incoming frame. Used when replay protection is on.
\end{description}

One thing to be noticed is that neither Key Strategy nor ACL is implemented on our platform. We give more details about key management of 802.15.4 Security in Contiki implementation in \Cref{Subsec: 802.15.4 Security Implementation in Contiki}.

\subsection{Nonce of CCM* in 802.15.4 Security}
As stated earlier in \Cref{Subsec: 802154 Sec}, CCM* requires that the format of ciphertext can be uniquely deduced from the nonce. \Cref{Fig: CCM nonce} describes the nonce used for encryption.

\begin{figure*}[h!]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
		\hline 
		1 (bytes) & 8              & 4             & 1              & 2             \\ \hline
		Flag      & Source Address & Frame Counter & Security Level & Block Counter \\ \hline
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{CCM* nonce for encryption}
	\label{Fig: CCM nonce}
\end{figure*}

\begin{description}[style=nextline]
	\item[\textbf{Flag}]
	 Deduced by MTU. In case of 802.15.4, it is constantly 0x02.
	\item[\textbf{Source Address}]
	Address of sender. Addresses less than 8 bytes will be extended.
	\item[\textbf{Frame Counter}]
	Directly mapped from Frame Counter in Auxiliary Security Header.
	\item[\textbf{Security Level}]
	Directly mapped from Security Level in Auxiliary Security Header with the highest bit set to $0$. Security Level solely determines the format of ciphertext.
	\item[\textbf{Block Counter}]
	Index of data blocks in MAC payload, with the first block being 0 and increases by one for each block. The block length is 128 bits since AES-128 is the underlining block cipher.
\end{description}

802.15.4 Security could either be implemented by hardware and/or software. Some platform may not support the security option, or only a sub set. We describe the 802.15.4 Security implementation on Contiki in \Cref{Subsec: 802.15.4 Security Implementation in Contiki}.

\subsection{802.15.4 Security Implementation in Contiki} \label{Subsec: 802.15.4 Security Implementation in Contiki}
noncoresec\cite{noncoresec} is the 802.15.4 Security implementation in Contiki. It is a reduced implementation of 802.15.4 Security which supports only a network shared key hard coded into the kernel code.

\subsection{Sub Layer: RDC Layer}

In practical, the radio transceiver turned out to be the most energy consuming part in a sensor node. Further more, listening to data consumes more energy than sending. Therefore an improvement of energy efficiency is to switch off the transceiver for most of the time and only turn it on when there is data on air. The Radio Duty Cycle, RDC, Sub Layer is therefore defined as part of MAC Layer which controls the behaviour of radio transceiver.

There are two RDC protocols implemented in our platform.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{nullrdc}. There is no RDC protocol. The transceiver is always kept on.
\item \textbf{ContikiMAC\cite{ContikiMAC}}. The transceiver is kept off for most of the time and only wakes up for a short period. If data transmission is detected during the wake-up period, the receiver keeps the transceiver on until the frame is received and informs the sender with an ACK. On the other hand, the sender continuously retransmits the frame until an ACK is received or timeout.
\end{itemize}

Time-Slotted Channel Hopping\cite{TSCH}, TSCH, is another RDC protocol that is adopted by OpenWSN. We omit its further detail as it is not yet implemented on our platform.

\section{Network Layer}
The MAC Layer protocols defined the data transmission over directly linked nodes. However, real world applications are usually deployed in a wider range that physically cannot be covered by only direct connections, such as smart city applications. The solution is to build a logical connection that allows the data to be forwarded by intermediate nodes until it reaches the destination. Such logical connection is called a multi hop connection with respect to directly connected single hop connection. As a result, arbitrary nodes can connect to each others and hence forms a network.

Network Layer protocols aim at the routing and addressing problems. The transmission unit in Network Layer is called a packet.

There are two typical types of network in WSN applications:
\begin{description}[style=nextline]
	\item[\textbf{Star Network}]
	Star network is a centralised network as in \Cref{fig: Star Network}. Each node is directly linked to the centre. Star networks are easier to implement and require less resources thus adequate to smaller applications. The drawback is that it is not flexible and scalable, and it is inefficient on communications between leafs.
	%CONTINUE FROM HERE 20160217
	\item[\textbf{Mesh Network}]
	Mesh network has a decentralised structure as in \Cref{fig: Mesh Network}. Every node is capable to forward packets. Comparing to star network, mesh network is more flexible and scalable but also more complicate and harder to implement. Mesh network is more practical than star network in large scale applications, such as smart cities.
\end{description}

\end{figure*}

Some network are built with a hybrid approach of star network and mesh network, e.g. the Cluster Tree Network of Zigbee\cite{Zigbee} as showed in \Cref{fig: ZigBee Topologies}.

\begin{figure*}[h!]

	\caption{Different ZigBee Network Topologies} \label{fig: ZigBee Topologies}
\end{figure*}

6LoWPAN is a currently well adopted network standard. It has the following features making it popular in IoT industry: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Each device is assigned with an IPv6 address of compressed format. With a border router that translates the compressed IPv6 address into an IP address, a node inside 6LoWPAN  can directly communicate with a host over Internet.
	\item Its mesh routing feature lead to a flexible, scalable and robust network, as the network can spontaneously reorganise itself at running time.
	\item It is standardised by IETF and well supported in industry.
\end{itemize}

As of this project, we are particularly interested into 6LoWPAN due to the reasons above. Packets in a 6LoWPAN can be categorised into two classes:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{IPv6 Data Packets}
	\item \textbf{ICMPv6 Packets}
\end{enumerate}
We give a brief explanation of their contents in \Cref{Subsec: IPv6 Data Packets} and \Cref{Subsec: ICMPv6} respectively.

\subsection{6LoWPAN Adaptation Sub Layer} \label{Subsec:6LoWPAN Adaptation Sub Layer}
A sub layer is defined in 6LoWPAN standard\cite{rfc4944} to compress a standard IPv6 header, in order to reduce the overhead induced by protocol stacks and provide more bandwidth to the applications. Additional headers are prepended before the IPv6 header as shown in \Cref{Fig: 6LoWPAN Adaptation Header}. 

\begin{figure*}[h!]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
		\hline
		6LoWPAN Adaptation Header & Compressed IPv6 Header & IPv6 Payload \\ \hline
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{6LoWPAN Adaptation Header}
\label{Fig: 6LoWPAN Adaptation Header}
\end{figure*}

The header compression is generally done by:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Optimised encoding. Take the Hop Limit, HLIM or TTL (Time To Live), field for example, the frequently used values, 1, 64 and 255, are represented in 2 bits as 01b, 10b and 11b respectively, saving 6 bits from its original 1 byte field.
	\item Since 6LoWPAN has usually less devices than a normal IPv6 network. The unused higher bits are therefore re-encoded. Technically speaking this is also a kind of optimised encoding.
\end{itemize}
The header compression is a lossless; thus we can always reconstruct an equivalent IPv6 header from the compressed header and this header compression information. We omitted further complicated details due to its complexity but they are defined in \cite{rfc6282}.

In addition to header compression, 6LoWPAN Adaptation Header also contains information for packet fragmentation as well as device address conflict avoiding. We omit the further details as it is beyond the scope of this report. Details of these mechanisms are defined in \cite{rfc4944}.

\subsection{IPv6 Data Packets} \label{Subsec: IPv6 Data Packets}
These packets contains the IPv6 payload. In 6LoWPAN, the IPv6 header is compressed as described in \Cref{Subsec:6LoWPAN Adaptation Sub Layer}. In this section we explain the contents of a standard IPv6 header instead of a compressed one for convenience but one can always uniquely transform a standard IPv6 header to a compressed one since they are indeed equivalent.

IPv6 is defined in \cite{rfc2460}. Its basic format is as shown in \Cref{Fig: IPv6 Packet Format}. We removed the length information as they are inconsistent when the header is compressed.

\begin{figure*}[h!]

	\begin{tabular}{l|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
	\cline{2-7}
	\multirow{2}{*}{\textit{IP Header}} & Version & Traffic Class & Flow Label & Payload Length & Next Header & Hop Limit \\ \cline{2-7} 
	                                & \multicolumn{3}{c|}{Source Address}  & \multicolumn{3}{c|}{Destination Address} \\ \cline{2-7} 
	\textit{IP Payload}                 & \multicolumn{6}{c|}{Payload}                                                    \\ \cline{2-7} 
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Basic IPv6 Packet Format} \label{Fig: IPv6 Packet Format}
\end{figure*}

\begin{description}[style=nextline]
	\item[\textbf{Version}]
	In 6LoWPAN this is constant 0x6.
	\item[\textbf{Traffic Class}]
	This field is default by 0 and may be set by an upper layer application as a hint of packet. A router can act accordingly to this field, such as adjusting the priority of packet, or even modify this value upon forward. The support for values other than $0$ is optional.
	\item[\textbf{Flow Label}]
	This field is intended to label a logical data path at Network Layer. The IPv6 standard\cite{rfc2460} states  it should ``be used by a source to label sequences of packets for which it requests special handling by the IPv6 routers, such as non-default quality of service or `real-time` service``. Support to this field is optional.
	\item[\textbf{Payload Length}]
	This field specifies the length of Network Layer payload.
	\item[\textbf{Next Header}]
	This field specifies the Transportation Layer protocol to be used. In WSN applications this is usually UDP. We will cover more of this in \Cref{Sec: Transportation Layer}.
	\item[\textbf{Hop Limit}]
	Hop Limit, HLIM, is also called Time To Live, TTL. It decreases by one whenever the packet is forwarded. The packet will be dropped when this value reaches $0$. This prevents a packet from being infinitely forwarded.
	\item[\textbf{Source Address and Destination Address}]
	These are the IPv6 addresses of sender and receiver. These are addresses are normally consistent during routing of a packet. In comparison,MAC source and destination varies on each hop, as an intermediate receiver becomes the sender of next hop.
	\item[\textbf{Payload}]
	This field contains the upper layer protocol headers and application data.
\end{description}
One thing to be noticed is that Traffic Class and Flow Label is not yet fully defined by IPv6 standard.

There are also extension headers defined in IPv6\cite{rfc2460}, including IPsec and fragmentation ,etc.

IPsec is defined in \cite{rfc4301} with its Authentication Header, AH, defined by \cite{rfc4302} and Encapsulating Security Payload, ESP, defined by \cite{rfc4303}. AH authenticates all IP Headers (the basic IPv6 header and the extensions) except fields  those might be modified by a router such as TTL. ESP provides encryption over IP Payload. Enabling IPsec over IPv6 adds 40 bytes to the IP Header which is unacceptable in IoT environment. \cite{6LoWPANIPsec} and \cite{CompressIPsec} discusses compression of IPsec over 6LoWPAN. \cite{ContikiIPsec} describes an implementation of IPsec over Contiki but it is not yet adopted by the latest released Contiki 3.0.

We omit further details of other extension headers as they are mostly used to handle routing and fragmentation and thus beyond the scope of this report.

\subsection{ICMPv6 Packets} \label{Subsec: ICMPv6}
Internet Control Message Protocol for IPv6, ICMPv6, is a set of messages that are used to maintain the network. \cite{rfc4443} defines the general format alongside with ICMPv6 Error Messages and Information Messages. 

%IPv6 General Format
In IPv6, an ICMP messages is preceded by an IPv6 Basic Header and optional IPv6 extension headers with the last Next Header field set to ICMP as \Cref{Fig: ICMP with IPv6}. The IP Payload in \Cref{Fig: IPv6 Packet Format} is replaced by an ICMP message in this case.

\begin{figure*}[h!]

	\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
		\hline
		IPv6 Basic Header & Extension Headers (optional) & ICMP Message \\ \hline
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{ICMP Message with IPv6 Headers}
	\label{Fig: ICMP with IPv6}
\end{figure*}

The general format of an IPv6 message is described in \cite{rfc4443} as \Cref{Fig: General Format of ICMPv6 Message}.
\begin{figure*}[h!]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
	\hline
	1 (byte) & 1    & 2        & *            \\ \hline

	\end{tabular}
	\caption{General Format of ICMPv6 Message}
	\label{Fig: General Format of ICMPv6 Message}
\end{figure*}

As stated in \cite{rfc4443},
\begin{description}[style=nextline]
\item[\textbf{Type}]
There are two groups of types of messages defined in \cite{rfc4443}. Error messages have a Type value in $[0,127]$ which indicates an error of network. Information messages have a type value in $[128,255]$ which provide network information to nodes of the network.
\item[\textbf{Code}]
Each type of ICMP message defines its own code to indicate the exact functionality of an ICMP message.
\item[\textbf{Checksum}]
Checksum for the packet.
\end{description}

We explain only a minor set of ICMP Messages that we have successfully observed in our experiment.
%Error messages, informative message
\begin{description}[style=nextline]
\item[\textbf{Echo Request and Reply Messages}]
These are diagnostic ICMP Information messages. Upon receiving an ICMP Echo Request, the receiving node is required by \cite{rfc4443} to reply with an identical ICMP message except the source and destination addresses are inverted. The Echo Request is typically sent by a PING command for diagnostic reasons such as testing of connectivity or measuring the Round Trip Time, RTT, of a data path. The response of ICMP Echo is enabled in Contiki by default but it is disabled on many Internet server for security reasons.
\end{description}

%RPL messages
A family of ICMPv6 messages, RPL messages, are defined by \cite{rfc6550}. RPL messages are fundamental in forming and self-organising a 6LoWPAN network. A 6LoWPAN network instance is a Destination Oriented Directed Acyclic Graph, DODAG, shown in \Cref{Fig: DODAG}. 
\begin{figure*}[h!]

	\label{Fig: DODAG}
\end{figure*}
We omit further details of the decision of a routing path as it is beyond the scope of this report but they are defined in \cite{rfc6550}. Instead, we explain the major related ICMP messages in a 6LoWPAN network.
%DODAG Information Solicitation
%DODAG Information Object
%Destination Advertisement Object
\begin{description}[style=nextline]
\item[\textbf{DAG Information Object (DIO) Message}]
The DIO message contains the global information of a 6LoWPAN network. It is broadcasted by a node to its neighbours periodically for maintenance, or as a reply on request of a new joining node to provide enough information for the new one to join the network.

\item[\textbf{DAG Information Solicitation (DIS) Message}]
When a new node is booted, it broadcasts DIS messages probing an existing 6LoWPAN network. If the DIS message is received by any neighbour node that belong to a network, then a DIO message is replied providing the information to join the network.

\item[\textbf{Destination Advertisement Object (DAO) Message}]
DAO Message is sent by a child node to its precedents to propagate its routing information. The routing information is later used when another node tries to send a packet to this child node. The receiving parent can either store the routing information or forward it to an upper level parent depending on its capability.
\end{description}

\cite{rfc6550} also defined secure variants to these RPL messages which provides authentication as well as confidentiality. However, they are not implemented on our platform and therefore we omit their details in this report.

\section{Transport Layer} \label{Sec: Transportation Layer}
Transport Layer defines the interface to applications. To be more specifically, ports are defined at this layer in addition to network addresses allowing packets to be directed to different applications running on the same host. Transport Layer protocols also define more semantic details of the data channel, such as reliability and modes data operation.

TCP and UDP are the most widely used Transport Layer protocols over Internet. TCP provides a reliable streamed data channel whilst UDP provides only unreliable datagrams. In the world of IoT, UDP is generally preferable due to its low overhead and support to multicast.

\subsection{UDP}
UDP is defined by \cite{rfc768}. Its format is shown in \Cref{Fig: UDP Datagram Format}
\begin{figure*}[h!]
	\center
	\begin{tabular}{ccccc}
		\multicolumn{4}{c}{\textit{UDP Header}}                                                                                                                & \textit{UDP Payload}         \\ \hline
		\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{\textit{2 (bytes)}} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{2}                & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{2}              & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{2}        & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{*}       \\ \hline
		\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{Source Port}        & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{Destination Port} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{Payload Length} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{Checksum} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{Payload} \\ \hline
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{UDP Datagram Format}
	\label{Fig: UDP Datagram Format}
\end{figure*}

\begin{description}[style=nextline]
	\item[\textbf{Source and Destination Port}]
	Ports are the identifier of applications running on a host. The source port and destination port semantically represent the applications that send and receive the data respectively.
	\item[\textbf{Payload Length}]
	The length of UDP payload.
	\item[\textbf{Checksum}]
	Checksum of the packet. The checksum is optional in \cite{rfc768} but is required in 6LoWPAN.
	\item[\textbf{Payload}]
	The application data.
\end{description}

The UDP header constitutes of 8 bytes and contains only the minimum information for the OS to identify the receiving process of a packet. Data transmission of UDP is unreliable, which means the data might be lost or arrive disordered.

The combination of a network address and a port is called an entity in network term.

\section{Application Layer}
%DTLS
%MQTT
%CoAP
This layer represents the various applications on the architecture. Some Application Layer protocols may beneath other applications, such as TLS and DTLS are sometimes viewed as a sub layer protocol of Transport Layer.

In this section we describe two typical Application Layer protocols that has been implemented on our platform, namely DTLS\cite{rfc6347} and CoAP\cite{rfc7252}. A real application can be built on these protocols.

\subsection{DTLS}
DTLS\cite{rfc6347} stands for Datagram Transport Layer Security. As of TLS, it provides end-to-end data confidentiality and authenticity. The main difference between DTLS and TLS is that:
\begin{itemize}
	\item DTLS is built on datagrams instead of TCP like TLS. In case of a 6LoWPAN network, this is effectively UDP. As a result DTLS implemented a simple reliable transmission mechanism during handshake to reliably exchange the cryptographic materials.
	\item Explicit sequence number and epoch values on each DTLS record. We explain theses values in following context.
	\item Invalid records no longer terminate the connection. Instead, errors are suppressed to the upper layer application and an alert is sent.
	\item RC4 is disabled due to its stateful design\cite{DtlsCiphers}. It is hard to maintain synchronised stated with UDP.
\end{itemize}

A packet containing Application Layer data is called a record. The format of a DTLS record is as depicted in \Cref{Fig: DTLS Record Format}.
\begin{figure*}[h!]
	\center
	\begin{tabular}{cccccc}
		\multicolumn{5}{c}{\textit{DTLS Header}}                                                                                                                                     & \textit{DTLS Encrypted Payload} \\ \hline
		\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{1 (byte)}     & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{2}                & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{2}     & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{6}               & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{2}      & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{*}          \\ \hline
		\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{Content Type} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{Protocol Version} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{Epoch} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{Sequence Number} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{Length} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{Fragment}   \\ \hline
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{DTLS Record Format}
	\label{Fig: DTLS Record Format}
\end{figure*}

\begin{description}[style=nextline]
	\item[\textbf{Content Type}]
	Content Type is inherited from TLS. It indicates the type of this record. The value can either be:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item CHANGE\_CIPHER\_SPEC($20$)
		\item ALERT($21$)
		\item HANDSHAKE($22$)
		\item APPLICATION\_DATA($23$)
	\end{enumerate}
	In the case of CHANGE\_CIPHER\_SPEC and HANDSHAKE, the sub protocols are invoked accordingly. Otherwise the Fragment field is treated as an error code in case of ALERT or ciphertext of application data in case of APPLICATION\_DATA.
	\item[\textbf{Protocol Version}]
	DTLS uses the complement of \{0xff, 0xff\} to indicate the version number. Since the implementation on our platform is for DTLS 1.2, this field is constantly \{0xfe, 0xfd\}.
	\item[\textbf{Epoch}]
	This field is incremented by one for each cipher state change, such as an invocation of \\
	CHANGE\_CIPHER\_SPEC. This value is used as an index of which set of cryptographic materials to be used, such as algorithms, keys or nonces.
	\item[\textbf{Sequence Number}]
	This field is the sequence number of this record. The sequence number is used by some cryptographic algorithms, such as to form a part of nonce.
	\item[\textbf{Length}]
	The length of Fragment field.
	\item[\textbf{Fragment}]
	The content of Fragment depends on Content Type. In the case of APPLICATION\_DATA, the Fragment contains the ciphertext.
\end{description}

The DTLS on Contiki is implemented by a third party code, tinydtls-0.8.2\cite{tinydtls}. Its current version supports two ciphersuites, namely:
\begin{itemize}
	\item TLS\_ECDHE\_ECDSA\_WITH\_AES\_128\_CCM\_8\cite{rfc7251}
	\item TLS\_PSK\_WITH\_AES\_128\_CCM\_8\cite{rfc6655}
\end{itemize}
Both ciphersuites adopts the same AEAD scheme, AES\_128 with CCM mode, as their cryptographic primitives. Further details of the AEAD scheme is defined in \cite{rfc5116} and \cite{CCM}.

One thing to be noticed is that DTLS is not compatible with the multicast feature of IPv6 and UDP. The direct reason is the distribution of cryptographic materials poses a great difficulty in IoT applications. \cite{DtlsMulticast1} and \cite{DtlsMulticast2} discuss this topic in further details.

As of this project, we are mostly focused on the APPLICATION\_DATA records rather than the handshake process, as we consider the later to be performed independently from any upper layer application.

\subsection{CoAP}
Constrained Application Protocol, CoAP, is a general application data interface defined in \cite{rfc7252}. CoAP can be viewed as a variation of HTTP that is specifically designed to access resources on IoT devices. The high level concept of CoAP is to make accessing data on sensor nodes behaves as accessing resources of a web site on Internet. Generally speaking,
\begin{itemize}
	\item Typically the sensor node runs a CoAP server application and registers its resources (sensors, actuators) to CoAP server. The management node, operated by an user or higher level application, access the resources as a CoAP client. In some cases the sensor node can also be a CoAP client and requests operational information from the management node which in this case runs as a CoAP server.
	\item Similar to HTTP, CoAP uses a Request-Response application model. That is, the CoAP client actively sends Requests to CoAP server, the CoAP server passively replies to each Request with a Response.
\end{itemize}

We show an example of the execution of CoAP protocol in \Cref{Fig: An Example of CoAP}.
\begin{figure*}[h!]
	\center
	\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{fig/CoapExample.png}
	\caption{An Example of CoAP}
	\label{Fig: An Example of CoAP}
\end{figure*}

In the example of \Cref{Fig: An Example of CoAP}, the CoAP server is a CC2538 node registered with several resources, ‘’actuators’’, ‘’hello’’ and ‘’leds’’, etc. The CoAP client is a desktop accessing the data on the sensor node through the Copper plugin\cite{Copper} of Firefox. As shown in \Cref{Fig: An Example of CoAP}, CoAP has the following features:
\begin{itemize}
	\item A node in the 6LoWPAN network is represented by an URL. In \Cref{Fig: An Example of CoAP}, we can see at the address bar the resources of node is represented in a form of URL:\\
	\url{coap://[aaaa::212:4b00:41e:afc6]:5683/.well-known/core} \\
	This is exactly as the same format of those URLs on Internet: \\
	 \{PROTOCOL :// ADDRESS : PORT / LOCATION \}.
	 \item Resources available on the node is organised in a tree structure, as shown in the tree view on the left in \Cref{Fig: An Example of CoAP}. These resources can be specified by the URL as shown in the address bar.
	 \item Similar to HTTP, four methods, namely GET, POST, PUT and DELETE, are defined to access and manipulate the resources on sensor nodes. In addition, a new new option OBSERVE is also defined for GET method which allows a CoAP server to actively push data to the CoAP client. We explain more details of these methods later in the context.
\end{itemize}
%CoAP as TCP
In addition to the definition of general application data interface, CoAP also provides a lightweight reliable transmission mechanism (described later in the context) as well as a fragmentation mechanism\cite{CoapBlock}; therefore some context consider CoAP as a Transport Layer protocol that is an alternative of TCP. For example, \cite{CoDTLS} proposes to use CoAP to perform the DTLS handshake instead of the built in retransmission mechanism of DTLS. CoAP also supports multicast messages as it is based on UDP, comparing to HTTP which is generally based on TCP and supports only one to one communication.
%CoAP format
\Cref{Fig: CoAP Message Format} describes the format of a CoAP message. The Token and Options adopt a length-value representation and thus their lengths are variable. The length of Payload is not explicitly stated but is calculated from the upper layer length.
\begin{figure*}[h!]
	\center
	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
	\hline
	2 bits  & 2 bits & 4 bits       & 1 byte & 2 bytes   & * & *       & 1 byte    & *       \\ \hline
	Version & Type   & Token Length & Code   & Message ID & Token                 & Options & Payload Marker & Payload \\ \hline
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{CoAP Message Format}
	\label{Fig: CoAP Message Format}
\end{figure*}

\begin{description}[style=nextline]
	\item[\textbf{Version}]
	This is the version of CoAP. Currently this is constantly 0x01.
	\item[\textbf{Type}]
	Type field contains the transmission related information. There are four values defined:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Confirmable(0)}: The message must be confirmed by an acknowledgement, otherwise the sender will attempt to retransmit the message.
		\item \textbf{Non confirmable(1)}: The message does not need to be confirmed and thus the transmission is unreliable.
		\item \textbf{Acknowledgement(2)}: This value is set to confirm the reception of a Confirmable(0) message. Piggyback, i.e. application data sent together within same message, is allowed in CoAP acknowledgement.
		\item \textbf{Reset(3)}: This value is similar to the RST flag in TCP which usually indicates a fatal error in connection and no further message should be sent on the same connection.
	\end{itemize}
	\item[\textbf{Token Length}]
	This field indicates the length of Token field. We explain Token field in the following context.
	\item[\textbf{Code}]
	Code indicates the class of content. The higher 3 bits indicates the class of this message:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Request(0)}: Sent by client requesting access of data of server.
		\item \textbf{Success Response(2)}: A Response by server indicates a successful Request.
		\item \textbf{Client Error Response(4)}: A Response by server indicates an error in the Request. This can be resulted from syntax error in Request or the serve is not capable to process the Request.
		\item \textbf{Server Error Response(5)}: A Response by server indicates an error happened in the server. In this case, the Request is valid such but the server failed due to some internal error.
	\end{itemize}
	The lower 5 bits indicates further details of the code.
	If the message is a Request, these bits indicates the method in the Request:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{GET}: The client requests to read the specified resources. Specifically when the OBSERVE option is set for a GET request, the resources can be pushed to the client  without further Requests\cite{rfc7641}.
		\item \textbf{PUT}: The client requests to write the specified resources to a value provided by the client.
		\item \textbf{POST}: The client requests to update the specified resources by a value provided by the client.
		\item \textbf{DELETE}: The client requests to remove data of the specified resources.
	\end{itemize}
	By definition, GET, PUT and DELETE are idempotent, i.e. execution of the Request is stateless. However, the definitions above are only semantic and are not mandatory. Implementations of higher level application could still violate the definitions, such as modifying the data on GET Request.
	
	In case of a Response, the lower bits inherited the error codes in HTTP, as defined in \cite{rfc2616}.
	\item[\textbf{Message ID}]
	Message ID is the index of a message. It is mostly used in reliable transmission to match an acknowledgement with its original message.
	\item[\textbf{Token}]
	Token is an index for a Request-Response session. A Response is matched to a Request with Token. Notice that Message ID and Token are different indexes, since same Token might be reused for multiple messages due to fragmentations, or OBSERVE option, etc.
	\item[\textbf{Options}]
	Options are the arguments for a message, such as URI, content format and size, etc. Different Options are defined for each Request and Response. The full list of Options is defined in \cite{rfc7252}.
	\item[\textbf{Payload Mark}]
	Payload Marker marks the end of Options and any data followed should be treated as Payload.
	\item[\textbf{Payload}]
	This is the application data contained in this message. The content of this field varies according to Code and higher level application.
\end{description}

Based on the similarity between CoAP and HTTP, a CoAP message can be easily translated between its HTTP counterpart by a Cross-Protocol Proxy, as depicted in \cite{rfc7252}.

Erbium\cite{Erbium} project is the CoAP implementation on Contiki, described in \cite{ContikiCoap}. It implements the CoAP engine and defined an interface for developers to implement their own application over the framework. Simply speaking, what developers need to do to integrate their own code into the CoAP framework is simply register their own callback function to the CoAP engine to handle the Requests to different resources.

\subsection{CoAPs}
CoAPs is the security version of CoAP which is the counterpart of HTTPS to HTTP. CoAPs adopts DTLS as the security measure and the any CoAP message should be encrypted as DTLS payload when using CoAPs. CoAPs is defined by \cite{rfc7252} as shown in \Cref{Fig: CoAPs Message}.

\begin{figure*}[h!]
	\center
	\begin{tabular}{cc}
		\textit{}                                  & \textit{DTLS Encrypted Payload}            \\ \hline
		\multicolumn{1}{|c|}{\textit{DTLS Header}} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{CoAP Message} \\ \hline
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{CoAPs Message}
	\label{Fig: CoAPs Message}
\end{figure*}

The current version of DTLS does not support the multicast feature of CoAP. The multicast alternation of DTLS proposed by \cite{DtlsMulticast1} and \cite{DtlsMulticast2} could be used to adapt CoAPs to multicast messages.

\cite{Lithe} proposes an integration of CoAP and DTLS with compressed headers. Unfortunately we have failed to adapt its source code to our platform as it is implemented on an earlier Contiki version that does not support our device. We have yet found any valid CoAPs implementation on our platform as well.

\section{RIME Stack}
RIME Stack\cite{RIME} is a non-layered WSN communication framework proposed alongside with earlier version of Contiki. Instead of dividing communication between nodes in a layered structure as the OSI model does, RIME Stack organises the communications of WSN in a way such that:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Each node is identified by a RIME address. In practice, the RIME address is directly derived from the hardware address.
	\item RIME Stack defines a set of abstracted communication primitives that can be directly invoked by the applications as well as a set of arguments that controls the connection.
	\item The Chameleon architecture\cite{RIME} acts as an intermediate virtualisation layer that translates RIME Stack primitives and arguments into underneath MAC frames and vice versa.
\end{itemize}
Comparing to 6LoWPAN, RIME Stack is more flexible and efficient. However since routing is solely depends on application, RIME Stack is not adequate to fast application development and would be hard to scale when used in applications with complicated communication models.

\section{Summary}
%Protocol suite
In \Cref{Chp: Building Blocks} we introduced a set of building blocks that could be use to build a secure WSN.  We introduced the protocol stack layer by layer within a simplified OSI model\cite{OSI}, as summarised in \Cref{Tbl: Summary of WSN Building Blocks}:

\end{table*}

This protocol suite we adopted is expected to be general, as 802.15.4 standard is widely supported by recent IoT devices and 6LoWPAN network is adaptable to most applications while possessing a great interoperability with the current Internet by its nature. CoAP is also considered the application layer consideration for its generality and interoperability. The selected protocol suite is implemented on our platform, Contiki\cite{Contiki}.

OpenWSN\cite{OpenWSN} can alternatively be used to build a WSN as it supports the same ‘’802.15.4 + 6LoWPAN + CoAP’’ protocol suite, except that it implements TSCH instead of ContikiMAC. In addition, WSN other protocols could possibly be adopted at different layers, such as BLE\cite{BLE} for Physical and MAC Layer, or ZigBee for Network Layer. We leave the research on other platforms as future work.
